### Notebooks and Slideshow
There are 2 associated notebooks, one is for the visualization and one has the predictions, preprocessing, modelling and data engineering. 
To better understand the process and intuition of the notebooks, a good idea would be to go through the slideshow and discover the same steps in the notebook.
For the reason stated above, this readme file will be kept very short.

### Dataset
The dataset was taken from "https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer". The database was directly downloaded into Google drive. To run the notebooks,
just edit the paths that mount the notebooks to the Google drive and make sure to download the database from kaggle and upload it to the appropriate directory in Google drive
so that the notebooks can retrieve them.

### Research
There is also a research paper associated with it that thoroughly goes through the process of automating annotation with near perfect accuracy and optimizing the memory of the
models that are used to make predicitions on the dataset.

### Questions
